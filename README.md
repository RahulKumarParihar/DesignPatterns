<h1>Design Patterns</h1>
<p>In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.</p>

<h2>Creational design patterns</h2>
<p>These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Abstract Factory:</b> Creates an instance of several families of classes</li>
  <li><b>Builder:</b> Separates object construction from its representation</li>
  <li><b>Factory Method:</b> Creates an instance of several derived classes</li>
  <li><b>Object Pool:</b> Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use</li>
  <li><b>Prototype:</b> A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned</li>
  <li><b>Singleton:</b> A class of which only a single instance can exist</li>
</ul>

<h2>Structural design patterns</h2>
<p>These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Adapter:</b> Match interfaces of different classes</li>
  <li><b>Bridge:</b> Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation</li>
  <li><b>Composite:</b> A tree structure of simple and composite objects</li>
  <li><b>Decorator:</b> Add responsibilities to objects dynamically</li>
  <li><b>Facade:</b> A single class that represents an entire subsystem</li>
  <li><b>Flyweight:</b> A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing</li>
  <li><b>Private Class Data:</b> Restricts accessor/mutator access</li>
  <li><b>Proxy:</b> An object representing another object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavioral design patterns</h2>
<p>These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Chain of responsibility:</b> A way of passing a request between a chain of objects</li>
  <li><b>Command:</b> Encapsulate a command request as an object</li>
  <li><b>Interpreter:</b> A way to include language elements in a program</li>
  <li><b>Iterator:</b> Sequentially access the elements of a collection</li>
  <li><b>Mediator:</b> Defines simplified communication between classes</li>
  <li><b>Memento:</b> Capture and restore an object's internal state</li>
  <li><b>Null Object:</b> Designed to act as a default value of an object</li>
  <li><b>Observer:</b> A way of notifying change to a number of classes</li>
  <li><b>State:</b> Alter an object's behavior when its state changes</li>
  <li><b>Strategy:</b> Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class</li>
  <li><b>Template method:</b> Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass</li>
  <li><b>Visitor:</b> Defines a new operation to a class without change</li>
</ul>
